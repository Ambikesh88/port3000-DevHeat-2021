Jai Jawan Jai Kisaan üßë‚Äçüåæ


Hello Guys, our team port 3000 has come up with a solution on the topic "Back to the roots" named Kisan Mitra.
It is basically a platform which provides one stop destination for farmers to boost their productivity rate.

Also farmer can check weather from here.
Now through this page Kisaan will get an idea which crop to grow currently by seeing market price to gain maximum profit from them.
The problem is that Kisaan is not exposed to the opportunities or schemes currently running by the the government.
this page contains all the current effective Government Schemes so that kisaan never misses out any beneficial schemes and can apply to it through the portal.

Also one major problem is that kisan doesn't know some effective pesticides useful for the common crops so here kisaan can see the pesticides resulting in the effective growth of the crops.

Problem is that poor farmers is unable to buy costly equipments used for farming. so Kisaan Mitra also provides renting of modern equipments at a nominal rates.

Thank you everyone

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
